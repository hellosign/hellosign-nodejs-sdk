/**
 * When used together with merge fields, `custom_fields` allows users to add pre-filled data to their signature requests.  Pre-filled data can be used with \"send-once\" signature requests by adding merge fields with `form_fields_per_document` or [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) while passing values back with `custom_fields` together in one API call.  For using pre-filled on repeatable signature requests, merge fields are added to templates in the HelloSign UI or by calling [/template/create_embedded_draft](/api/reference/operation/templateCreateEmbeddedDraft) and then passing `custom_fields` on subsequent signature requests referencing that template.
