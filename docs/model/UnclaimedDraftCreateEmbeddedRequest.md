| `hideTextTags` | ```boolean``` |  Send with a value of `true` if you wish to enable automatic Text Tag removal. Defaults to `false`. When using Text Tags it is preferred that you set this to `false` and hide your tags with white text or something similar because the automatic removal system can cause unwanted clipping. See the [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) walkthrough for more details.  |  [default to false] |

| `showProgressStepper` | ```boolean``` |  When only one step remains in the signature request process and this parameter is set to `false` then the progress stepper will be hidden.  |  [default to true] |
| `signers` | [```Array<SubUnclaimedDraftSigner>```](SubUnclaimedDraftSigner.md) |  Add Signers to your Unclaimed Draft Signature Request.  |  |

| `usePreexistingFields` | ```boolean``` |  Set `use_text_tags` to `true` to enable [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) parsing in your document (defaults to disabled, or `false`). Alternatively, if your PDF contains pre-defined fields, enable the detection of these fields by setting the `use_preexisting_fields` to `true` (defaults to disabled, or `false`). Currently we only support use of either `use_text_tags` or `use_preexisting_fields` parameter, not both.  |  [default to false] |
| `useTextTags` | ```boolean``` |  Set `use_text_tags` to `true` to enable [Text Tags](https://app.hellosign.com/api/textTagsWalkthrough#TextTagIntro) parsing in your document (defaults to disabled, or `false`).

| `populateAutoFillFields` | ```boolean``` |  Controls whether [auto fill fields](https://faq.hellosign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051467511-Auto-Fill-Fields) can automatically populate a signer&#39;s information during signing.<br><br>⚠️ **Note** ⚠️: Keep your signer&#39;s information safe by ensuring that the _signer on your signature request is the intended party_ before using this feature.  |  [default to false] |
| `expiresAt` | ```number``` |  When the signature request will expire. Unsigned signatures will be moved to the expired status, and no longer signable.<br><br>**Note** This does not correspond to the **expires_at** returned in the response.  |  |
